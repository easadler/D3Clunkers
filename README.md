### Cash for Clunkers Analysis

This website is a single page application made with D3.js, Jquery, and Bootstrap. 
I used R to manipulate the data and D3.js to do the visualizations (see R Scripts folder). I was pressed for time 
so my code is functional but very ugly. The goal is to convert this to a React.js application 
and to have some serious analysis. 


##### Start the app
> $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
